<p>The organisation started as a small community which was headed by young person 
   known as Abdul Latif who thought of making the environment conducive to all organisms.
the organisation was able to start through small funds from well wishers and later on the government 
and other organisations joined through partnerships.</p>
<p>the organisation has been able to achieve much of its objective
    it has been able to build dams that assist in storage of water in both the arid and also
semi-arid areas.it has also asisted in reducing the environmental pollution by educating 
members of the community on ways of waste disposal and providing the necessary tools 
to implement that.

    and opening more branches across East Africa.
