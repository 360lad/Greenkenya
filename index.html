            <p>
              Desertication has been a very huge problem for Kenya .This led to
              the organization developing sollutions by planting trees and and
              having irrigation farms and teaching the community on the
              importance of planting trees and doing irrigation so as to make
              our country greener.And this enables us to get enough and water
              and hence we buy products from them and it also enables Us make

            <p>
              Plastic pollution is also one of the major pollutions in kenya
              ,thus the organization ventured into solving plastic pollution by
              having our own dumpsites and where we buy plastic waste from the
              local youth hence we provide employment and increasing the
              cleanliness of our society.We have multiple dump sites iin the
              country that are well mainteained so as not to pollute the
              environment .We have our own factories and we also export the
              plastic waste to other ccountries through our agency hence it
              helps growing the organization

            <h2>Water pollution</h2>
            <p>As it is is well known water is life.We as human beings require water since it is key for our body since 70% percent of blood comprises of water and we require water in carryig out biological processes in our body.Since there is luck of water in most deserted areas in our country. This leads to mulnitrition in children .Hence we decided as an organization to duel in building dams and reservours.We plant trees  so as to make the  various areas to attract water and change the climatic conditions in those areas and in return we sell water that we generate at a cheap price of 3KSH PER LITER.You may order water on our servvice page<a href="#">click Here</a></p>
